- `GET /rooms/price/{price}/or/available`: Retrieve available rooms with a price less than or equal to the specified price.
- `GET /rooms/AC/or/available`: Retrieve available rooms with AC, sorted by price.
- `DELETE /rooms/ids`: Delete multiple rooms by ID.

- `findByRoomPriceLessThanEqualOrRoomAvailable`: Retrieve available rooms with a price less than or equal to the specified price.
